The first set of wheels Ben built was for his Bridgestone MB-3, way back in the last century. Since then he's built hundreds of **custom, hand-built wheels** and mastered the craft of part selection, lacing, tensioning, and truing.

Whether you need super strong wheels for an 8,000 mile tour or light-weight tubulars for racing, Ben can help.  Tandem, mountain, road, cyclocross, touring and commuting bikes can all benefit from a nice set of wheels designed around their specific needs.  [Let us know](/contact) what  kind of riding you do and we can talk about what hubs, spokes, and rims are best for your application.

## Newer Isn’t Always Better

Have a vintage set of hubs that are in great shape but have worn out spokes and rims? Ben can rebuild a wheel using your existing parts and make an old wheel as good as new.

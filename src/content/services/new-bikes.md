## Strider: Balance Bikes

Balance bikes are a brilliant way to teach kids how to ride.  Ben started his son on a Strider at 18 months and his son loved it.  His ability to balance developed over the next 4-6 weeks.  The Strider gave him so much confidence in his balance that by the age of age of two and a half he had learned to ride a pedal bike (without training wheels). Some well-coordinated kids 4-5 years old can even learn to balance in a day!

## Soma: Steel Frames & Complete Bikes

Soma makes a nice selection of complete bikes and classic steel frames for all types of riding.  For frame purchases, Ben will work with you to select a frame and then build it up with a custom selection of parts that will fit your needs.  Want to brainstorm about a project that you have been thinking about?  Get in touch with Ben to explore various options for building up a beautiful new Soma bike!

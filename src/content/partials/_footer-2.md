## The Shop

The Wyse family and Wyse Cycles share a house/shop that was built to accommodate both their growing family and business. The basement shop provides a wonderful home base for Wyse Cycles, but it is not a conventional retail store, and Ben is often away fixing bikes at a location more convenient for his customers. The best way to contact Wyse Cycles is to [call, text or email](/contact).

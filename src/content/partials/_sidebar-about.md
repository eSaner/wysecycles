<h2 class="h3">Committed To Sustainability</h2>

Cycling is fun, healthy and good for the environment. But Ben rides the extra mile by incorporating cycling in all aspects of his business. Cycling to the jobsite means a car and conventional retail shop aren't necessary, lowering business overhead and making it feasible to repair bikes and parts that would be discarded or recycled in traditional bike shops. Because of it’s unique business model, Wyse Cycles is quite possibly the “greenest” bike shop in the country.
